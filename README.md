# Flight-Status
In this Project, I wanted to have a better understanding of Power BI, so I created a framework for the dashboard to know the flight status on-time, delayed and canceled trend between different airports and airlines. Then where I would put the data I want to show and how I change the format so not only is it easy on the eyes but easier to read the data on the dashboard.
